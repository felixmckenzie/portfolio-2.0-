    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hey there! <br></br>
    I'm Felix, currently I'm working towards a graduate diploma of IT at Coder Academy.
    My journey into web development started in 2020, when I was staying home during the pandemic alongside my 
    partner, Emma, who worked in sales for a web development bootcamp.
    After listening her describe the course on the phone to potential students, something clicked and I knew web development was what I wanted to pursue. 
    I enjoy lateral thinking and leaning new technologies, and couldn't think of a better way to pass the time while in lockdown.
    I stumbled across Free Code Camp and took their responsive web design and Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures Certifications. 
    The problem solving aspect was deeply satistfying, and I spent way more time coding than I first anticipated. 
   <br></br><br></br>
    When the restaurant I owned reopened, something was telling me it was time to make a change.
    I didn't quite know where to start. I took an Intro to Programming and Intro to Object Orientated Programming course through QUT, but eventually decided 
    Coder Academy was where I wanted to study.  
    <br></br><br></br>
    Coder Academy has extended my basic knowledge of writing code, to understanding the underlying layers that make up the web, computer science fundamentals, building 
    web applications, as well as collaborating, problem solving and sharing ideas with fellow students. 
    I'll be graduating in November 2022 and look forward to starting a new career in web development.
    <br></br><br></br>
    Professionally, I have worked in the hospitality industry for over 10 years, managing and eventually owning my own restaurant.
    In that time I have also completed a bachelor degree in Environmental Science. I've always valued science and the pursuit of new knowledge, which is why I believe
    I enjoy programming so much. 
    <br></br><br></br>
    When I'm not building something with code, I like camping and exploring national parks with my partner, Emma.
